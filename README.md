# [WYS-Documentation](https://github.com/thennothinghappened/WYS-Documentation/wiki)
 This repo exists with the goal of providing adaqute documentation for modders on the functions in [Will You Snail](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1115050/Will_You_Snail/).

Currently this is a barebones repo, but I'm working on it.
Any help in the documentation process, or cleaning up and providing more useful descriptions would be greatly appreciated.
